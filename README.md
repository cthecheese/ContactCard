# Contact Card
A simple editable contact card created purely through CSS with the added benefits that SASS gives.

## The Components
Simply put, you have 6 main components:

* The main card itself (cc-main)
* The section of the card that is animated (cc-flip)
* The front of the section that is animated (cc-front)
* The back of the section that is animated (cc-back)
* The description that contains the name and a breif description (cc-description)
* Three grids to choose from:
  * 1/6th Grid
  * 1/3rd Grid
  * 1/2 Grid

While these components were made originally with a specific intent of use, it is designed to be modular and give a developer a running start that they can modify to their own system.
